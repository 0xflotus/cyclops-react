# Features

Used in Aol to build robust, performant & scalable asynchronous systems : features include

* Compatible extensions to JDK interfaces (Collections, Streams, Functions)
* Built with [jOOÎ»](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOL), [reactive-streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/) ,[Agrona](https://github.com/real-logic/Agrona) and [pCollections](https://github.com/hrldcpr/pcollections)
* Extensions for efficient JDK compatible persistent collections ([pCollections](http://pcollections.org/))
* FutureStreams for managing aggregates for Future Tasks (e.g. for multi-threaded execution of large numbers of I/O tasks)
* Single-threaded asynchronous streaming
* Scheduling of data emission
* Powerful extended type hierarchy for aggregrations (Collections & Streams) and single values
* Powerful functional-style control structures, implemented in Java friendly manner (Maybe, Eval, FutureW, Xor, Ior, Try, AnyM, structural & guard based pattern matching, for-comprehensions)
* Execute functions between wrapped values (Optional / CompletableFutre etc) without tedious unwrapping (Java friendly Applicative support).
* Java friendly abstractions for wrapping any Monad type (Stream, CompletableFuture, Optional, cyclops-react types and types from other Java projects too). AnyM and it's two subtypes AnyMSeq for aggregates (Steam, List etc) and AnyMValue for Values
* Monad Transformers - for manipulating nesting monadic types (e.g. Optionals within a Stream as if it were just an Optional)
* Applicatives - apply functions across wrapped types (e.g. Optional / Maybe / Xor) without unwrapping & aggregate without terminate on failure
* Structural pattern matching & pattern matching via Guards (see Matchable and Matchables)
* Full strength for comprehensions / generators (reference elements from other generators)
* Tight integration with reactive-streams : collections, streams and datatypes are publishers & can be generated via subscribers

* Very Extensible & integration with other projects via cyclops-integration modules.
