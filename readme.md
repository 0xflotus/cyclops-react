#SimpleReact : Simple Fluent Api for Functional Reactive Programming with Java 8

SimpleReact is an easy to use, concurrent, reactive programming library for JDK 8. It is a fluent API, that implements java.util.stream.Stream, and is built on top of Java 8 CompletableFutures and the Stream API. It provides a focused, simple and limited Reactive API aimed at solving the 90% use case - but without adding complexity.

Since v0.3 SimpleReact also provides Scala Seq like functionality via [jOOÎ»'s Seq](http://www.jooq.org/products/jOO%CE%BB/javadoc/0.9.5/org/jooq/lambda/Seq.html), which is implemented by SimpleReact Stage. See [A Simple Api, and a Rich Api](https://github.com/aol/simple-react/wiki/A-simple-API,-and-a-Rich-API) for details on SimpleReact core and the java Streaming interfaces.

##Why SimpleReact


SimpleReact is built on top of JDK standard libraries and unlike other Reactive implementations for Java, specifically targets JDK 8 and thus reuses rather than reinvents  Streams, Functional interfaces etc. SimpleReact augments the *parallel* Streams functionality in JDK by providing a facade over both the Streams and CompletableFuture apis. Under-the-hood, SimpleReact *is* a Stream of CompletableFutures, and presents that externally as an api somewhat inspired by the Javascript Promises / A+ Spec (https://promisesaplus.com/).

Everything is concurrent in SimpleReact. While this does limit some of the syntax-sugar we can provide directly, the small & focused SimpleReact Api together with the Apis of the underlying JDK 8 primitives offer often surprising levels of power and flexibility.

* See an example of using CompletableFuture directly with SimpleReact : https://github.com/aol/simple-react/wiki/Example-:-Reacting-to-Asynchronous-Events-with-a-Stream-of-CompletableFutures

##Data flow

SimpleReact starts with an array of Suppliers which generate data other functions will react to. Each supplier will be passed to an Executor to be executed, potentially on a separate thread. Each additional step defined when calling Simple React will also be added as a linked task, also to be executed, potentially on a separate thread.

##Example 1 : reacting with completablefutures

React **with**

			List<CompletableFuture<Integer>> futures = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.with(it -> it * 100);

In this instance, 3 suppliers generate 3 numbers. These may be executed in parallel, when they complete each number will be multiplied by 100 - as a separate parrellel task (handled by a ForkJoinPool or configurable task executor). A List of Future objects will be returned immediately from Simple React and the tasks will be executed asynchronously.
React with does not block.
##Example 2 : chaining

React **then**

	 	new SimpleReact()
	 			.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)


React then allows event reactors to be chained. Unlike React with, which returns a collection of Future references, React then is a fluent interface that returns the React builder - allowing further reactors to be added to the chain.
React then does not block.
React with can be called after React then which gives access to the full CompleteableFuture api. CompleteableFutures can be passed back into SimpleReact via SimpleReact.react(streamOfCompleteableFutures);
See this blog post for examples of what can be achieved via CompleteableFuture :- http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/12/promises-and-completablefuture.html

React **retry**

	 	new SimpleReact()
	 			.<Integer> react(() -> url1, () -> url2, () -> url3)
				.retry(it -> readRemoteService(it))
				.then(it ->  extractData(it))
				.then(it -> writeToQueue(it))


Retry allows a stage to be retried a configurable number of times. Retry functionlity is provided by async-retry (https://github.com/nurkiewicz/async-retry), that provides a very configurable mechanism for asynchronous retrying based on CompletableFutures.
In SimpleReact a RetryExecutors can be plugged in at any stage. Once plugged in it will be used for the current and subsequent stages of the Stream (until replaced).

e.g.  

	new SimpleReact()
		.<Integer> react(() -> url1, () -> url2, () -> url3)
		.withRetrier(retryExecutor)
		.retry(it -> readRemoteService(it))

To configure a retry executor follow the instructions on https://github.com/nurkiewicz/async-retry. E.g :-

		
    ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
    RetryExecutor executor = new AsyncRetryExecutor(scheduler).
       retryOn(SocketException.class).
       withExponentialBackoff(500, 2).     //500ms times 2 after each retry
       withMaxDelay(10_000).               //10 seconds
       withUniformJitter().                //add between +/- 100 ms randomly
       withMaxRetries(20);
       
       
##Example 3: blocking

React and **block**

			List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.block();
						
In this example, once the current thread of execution meets the React block method, it will block until all tasks have been completed. The result will be returned as a List. The Reactive tasks triggered by the Suppliers are non-blocking, and are not impacted by the block method until they are complete. Block, only blocks the current thread.

##Example 4: breakout

Sometimes you may not need to block until all the work is complete, one result or a subset may be enough. To faciliate this, block can accept a Predicate functional interface that will allow SimpleReact to stop blocking the current thread when the Predicate has been fulfilled. E.g.

			List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.block(status -> status.getCompleted()>1);

In this example the current thread will unblock once more than one result has been returned. The available fields on the status object are :-
completed
errors
total
elapsedMillis

##Example 5 : onFail

React **onFail**
onFail allows disaster recovery for each task (a separate onFail should be configured for each react phase that can fail). E.g. if reading data from an external service fails, but default value is acceptable - onFail is a suitable mechanism to set the default value.

			List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 100, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> {
					if (it == 100)
						throw new RuntimeException("boo!");
		
					return it;
				})
				.onFail(e -> 1)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.block();

In this example, should the first "then" phase fail, the default value of 1 will be used instead.

##Example 6: non-blocking

React and **allOf**

allOf is a non-blocking equivalent of block. The current thread is not impacted by the calculations, but the reactive chain does not continue until all currently alloted tasks complete. The allOf task is then provided with a list of the results from the previous tasks in the chain. Any parallelStreams used inside allOf will reuse the SimpleReact ExecutorService - if it is a ForkJoinPool (which it is by default), rather than the Common ForkJoinPool parallelStreams use by default. 

        	boolean blocked[] = {false};
			new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)	
				.then(it -> {
					try {
						Thread.sleep(50000);
					} catch (Exception e) {
						
					}
					blocked[0] =true;
					return 10;
				})
				.allOf( it -> it.size());

		
			assertThat(blocked[0],is(false));

In this example, the current thread will continue and assert that it is not blocked, allOf could continue and be executed in a separate thread.

first() is a useful method to extract a single value from a dataflow that ends in allOf. E.g. 


        	boolean blocked[] = {false};
			int size = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)	
				.then(it -> {
					try {
						Thread.sleep(50000);
					} catch (Exception e) {
						
					}
					blocked[0] =true;
					return 10;
				})
				.allOf( it -> it.size()).first();

		
			assertThat(blocked[0],is(false));

##Example 7: non-blocking with the Stream api

             List<Integer> result =new SimpleReact()
             	.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> {
					return it*200;
				})
				.<Integer,Integer>allOf( (it )->{
					return it.parallelStream()
					.filter( f -> f>300)
					.map(m -> m-5)
					.reduce(0, (acc,next) -> acc+next); 
				}).block();

		
			assertThat(result.size(),is(1));
			assertThat(result.get(0),is(990));


In this example we block the current thread to get the final result, the allOf task uses the Streams api to setup another FRP chain that takes the inputs from our initial parellel jobs ([1,2,3] -> [200,400,600]), and does a filter / map/ reduce on them in parallel.

##Example 6 : capturing exceptions

React *capture*

onFail is used for disaster recovery (when it is possible to recover) - capture is used to capture those occasions where the full pipeline has failed and is unrecoverable.

			List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> {
					if (it == 100)
						throw new RuntimeException("boo!");
		
					return it;
				})
				.onFail(e -> 1)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.then(it -> {
					
					if ("*200".equals(it))
						throw new RuntimeException("boo!");
		
					return it;
				})
				.capture(e -> logger.error(e.getMessage(),e))
				.block();


In this case, strings will only contain the two successful results (for ()->1 and ()->3), an exception for the chain starting from Supplier ()->2 will be logged by capture. Capture will not capture the exception thrown when an Integer value of 100 is found, but will catch the exception when the String value "*200" is passed along the chain.

##Example 7 : using the Streams Api

React and the *Streams Api*

A SimpleReact Stage implements both [java.util.stream.Stream](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html) and [org.jooq.lambda](http://www.jooq.org/products/jOO%CE%BB/javadoc/0.9.5/org/jooq/lambda/Seq.html) Streaming interfaces. This section describes how to interact with the JDK implementation of java.util.stream.Stream. 

It is possible to reuse the internal SimpleReact ExecutorService for JDK 8 parallelStreams. SimpleReact uses a ForkJoinPool as the ExecutorService by default, and to reuse the ExecutorService with parallelStreams it must be a ForkJoinPool - so if you want to supply your own make sure it is also a ForkJoinPool. The easiest way to do this is via the submitAndBlock method.

*Detailed Explanation* A mechanism to share the SimpleReact ExecutorService with JDK Parallel Streams is provided via the *collectResults* method. NB This will only actually share the ExecutorService if it is an instance of ForkJoinPool (limitation imposed on JDK side). This method collects the results from the current active tasks, and clients are given the full range of SimpleReact blocking options.  The results will then be made available to a user provided function when the *submit* method is called. The submit method will ensure that the user function is executed in such a way that the SimpleReact ExecutorService will also be used by ParallelStreams. It does this by submiting the user function & results to the ForkJoinPool and ParallelStreams has been written in such away to resuse any ForkJoinPool it is executed inside.
 
A way to merge all these steps into a single method is also provided (submitAndBlock). 

Example :

		 Integer result = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> it * 200)
				.<List<Integer>,Integer>submitAndblock(
						it -> it.parallelStream()
								.filter(f -> f > 300)
								.map(m -> m - 5)
								.reduce(0, (acc, next) -> acc + next));
								
To use a different ExecutorService than SimpleReact's internal ExecutorService leverae parallelStream directly from block() 

			ImmutableMap<String,Integer> dataSizes = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 30,()->400)
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.<String>block()
				.parallelStream()
				.filter( it -> it.length()>3)
				.map(it -> ImmutableMap.of(it,it.length()))
				.reduce(ImmutableMap.of(),  (acc, next) -> ImmutableMap.<String, Integer>builder()
					      .putAll(acc)
					      .putAll(next)
					      .build());

In this example the converted Strings are filtered by length and an ImmutableMap created using the Java 8 Streams Api.


##Example 8 : peeking at the current stage

Particularly during debugging and troubleshooting it can be very useful to check the results at a given stage in the dataflow. Just like within the Streams Api, the peek method can allow you to do this.

Example :

	List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.<String>then(it -> "*" + it)
				.peek((String it) -> logger.info("Value is {}",it))
				.block();
				
##Example 9 : filtering results

The filter method allows users to filter out results they are not interested in.

Example :

	List<String> result = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.filter(it -> it.startsWith("*1"))
				.block();

##Example 10 : Concurrent iteration

SimpleReact provides a mechanism for starting a dataflow an iterator.

	List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4);
	List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(list.iterator() ,list.size())
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.block(); 
				
##Example 11 : Infinite generators & iterators

Since v0.2 SimpleReact supports fully Infinite Streams, See :- 

https://github.com/aol/simple-react/wiki/Infinite-Streams-in-SimpleReact
https://medium.com/@johnmcclean/plumbing-java-8-streams-with-queues-topics-and-signals-d9a71eafbbcc


SimpleReact provides a mechanism over JDK Stream iterate and generate which will create 'infinite' Streams of data to react to. Because SimpleReact eagerly collects these Streams (when converting to *active* CompletableFutures), the SimpleReact api always requires a maximum size parameter to be set.

	List<String> strings = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> count++ ,SimpleReact.times(4))
				.then(it -> it * 100)
				.then(it -> "*" + it)
				.capture(e -> capture++)
				.block();

##Example 12 : Splitting and merging SimpleReact dataflows

A simple example below where a dataflow is split into 3, processed separately then merged back into a single flow.

	Stage<String> stage = new SimpleReact()
				.<Integer> react(() -> 1, () -> 2, () -> 3)
				.then(it -> "*" + it);
		Stage<String> stage1 = stage.filter(it -> it.startsWith("*1"));
		Stage<String> stage2 = stage.filter(it -> it.startsWith("*2"));
		Stage<String> stage3 = stage.filter(it -> it.startsWith("*3"));
		
		stage1 = stage1.then(it -> it+"!");
		stage2 = stage2.then(it -> it+"*");
		stage3 = stage3.then(it -> it+"%");
		
		List<String> result = stage1.merge(stage2).merge(stage3).block();
