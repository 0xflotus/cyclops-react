# Data types in cyclops-react

1. Eval : Eval represents a compuations, and can either be immediate (Eval.now), deffered (Eval.always), or deffered and cached (Eval.later).
1. Maybe : Maybe is a more powerful version of Optional, most operations except for filter and flatMap are lazy.
1. Xor : eXclusive Or can hold one of two values, by default we bias it to one particular type (it will behave similarly to a Maybe of that type), but we can swap the primary (active) and secondary (hidden) types. Xor can be used to accumulate validation failures via Xor.sequence or Xor.ap
1. Validator is an active lazy Validator that can be used to validate input and produce either Validation results and / or sequencable Xors
1. Ior : an Inclusive Or can either hold one of two values or both. They can be sequenced in a similar manner to Xors.
1. Matchable : is a type that supports recursive structural pattern matching and pattern matching via guards
1. Try : offers Java friendly functional exceptional handling
1. FutureW : wraps CompletableFuture to provide a more powerful extended API
1. Trampoline : is a simple implementation of the 'Trampoline' pattern which converts recusrive method calls to iterative ones
1. Reader : Reader is a lazy execution pattern for dependency injection
1. Do : Do is a builder for advanced for-comprehensions over JDK and cyclops types
1. FeatureToggle : is a type that allows features to be enabled or disabled (for CI/CD pipelines in a simple modern, more functional manner)
1. FluentFunctions : is a class for manipulating method references and functions
1. AnyM is a wrapper for Any Monad type (i.e. Stream, Optional, CompletableFuture and many of the types here - Eval, Maybe, Reader, Xor, Ior, Try, FutureW), to subclasses AnyMSeq and AnyMValue are provided
1. ReactiveSeq is an extension to jOOÎ» Seq that implements the reactive-streams api adds in asyncrhonous and lazy stream execution
1. SimpleReact : is a builder for SimpleReact FutureStreams
1. LazyReact : is a builder for more advanced LazyFutureStreams
