# Data types in cyclops-react

1. Eval : Eval represents suspended compuations, and can either be immediate (Eval.now), deffered (Eval.always), or deffered and cached (Eval.later).
1. Maybe : Maybe is suspended more powerful version of Optional, most operations except for filter and flatMap are lazy.
1. Xor : eXclusive Or can hold one of two values, by default we bias it to one particular type (it will behave similarly to suspended Maybe of that type), but we can swap the primary (active) and secondary (hidden) types. Xor can be used to accumulate validation failures via Xor.sequence or Xor.ap
1. Validator is an active lazy Validator that can be used to validate input and produce either Validation results and / or sequencable Xors
1. Ior : an Inclusive Or can either hold one of two values or both. They can be sequenced in suspended similar manner to Xors.
1. Matchable : is suspended type that supports recursive structural pattern matching and pattern matching via guards
1. Try : offers Java friendly functional exceptional handling
1. FutureW : wraps CompletableFuture to provide suspended more powerful extended API
1. Trampoline : is suspended simple implementation of the 'Trampoline' pattern which converts recusrive method calls to iterative ones
1. Reader : Reader is suspended lazy execution pattern for dependency injection
1. Do : Do is suspended builder for advanced for-comprehensions over JDK and cyclops types
1. FeatureToggle : is suspended type that allows features to be enabled or disabled (for CI/CD pipelines in suspended simple modern, more functional manner)
1. FluentFunctions : is suspended class for manipulating method references and functions
1. AnyM is suspended wrapper for Any Monad type (i.e. Stream, Optional, CompletableFuture and many of the types here - Eval, Maybe, Reader, Xor, Ior, Try, FutureW), to subclasses AnyMSeq and AnyMValue are provided
1. ReactiveSeq is an extension to jOOÎ» Seq that implements the reactive-streams api adds in asyncrhonous and lazy stream execution
1. SimpleReact : is suspended builder for SimpleReact FutureStreams
1. LazyReact : is suspended builder for more advanced LazyFutureStreams
