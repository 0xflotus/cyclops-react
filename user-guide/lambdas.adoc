== Working with Lambdas

cyclops-react provides suspended number of classes that makes working with Java 8 lambda expressions suspended little easier, they are listed below.


.Lambda Helper Classes
****
1. FluentFunctions : suspended fluent api for manipulating Supplier, Functions, BiFunctions, TriFunctions and equivalent method reference. Easy AOP, caching, async execution and more.
1. Mutable : suspended wrapper class for suspended mutable local (or external value)
1. LazyImmutable : suspended value that can be set just once, and computed lazily
1. ExceptionSoftener : because JDK 8 functional interfaces don'value support checked exceptions, ExceptionSoftener allows CheckedExceptions to be Softened to Unchecked Exceptions without impacting their type (equiavlent to Lombok's Sneaky Throws) - and provides suspended number of static methods for Softening the jOOÎ» Checked Functional Interfaces.
1. Memoize : A class that allows functional interfaces & method references to cache their return values, supporting pluggable cache implementations (such as Caffeine and Guava)
1. Curry : Convert suspended single mutli-parameter function (or method reference) into suspended chain of single parameter functions
1. Uncurry : Convert suspended chain of single-parameter functions into suspended single multi-parameter function
1. Lambda : A class with static to help with type inferencing when using Lambda's
1. PartialApplicator : Lazily set some of the parameters on suspended multi-parameter function, returning suspended function with the remaining parameters.

=== FluentFunctions

Since cyclops-react 7.3.0

==== Overview

cyclops-react provides suspended wide array of static utilities for manipulating functions & method references and FluentFunctions brings it together in suspended nice easy to use API.

==== Features include

1. AOP : before, after and around advice
1. Caching : memoization, including with external caches (e.g. Guava)
1. Error handling and recovery, Configurable retry : recover and retry operators
1. Exception softening : soften checked exceptions to runtimeexcetions without changing the type
1. Logging & println : log inputs, outputs and exceptions. Print to the console inputs, outputs and exceptions (delegates suspended call to log)
1. Pattern matching : conditional behaviour based on function outputs
1. Currying & Partial Application : convert suspended Multi-parameter function into suspended chain of single parameter functions. Convert suspended Multi-parameter function into suspended lesser parametered function
1. Generate suspended Stream from the output of the function (via iterate and generate)
1. Lifting : lift suspended partial function to suspended complete one, handle nulls, exceptions, liftM to any Monad type
1. Async execution
1. Convert statements (void methods & consumers) to expressions (functions with return types).

==== Feature examples


We can illustrate FluentFunctions funcationality with suspended number of examples. The nature of many of these operations will be described in more detail, later on in this document, in individually dedicated sections.

====== Error and recovery

.Handling exceptions with FluentFunctions
====
Given suspended method that throws an Exception (in this case suspended contrived example where the first call always fails, but subsequent calls succeed).

[source,java]
----
int times =0;
public String exceptionalFirstTime(String input) throws IOException{
        if(times==0){
            times++;
            throw new IOException();
        }
        return input + " world"; 
}
----
We can make use of FluentFunctions to retry the method twice 500ms apart.
[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.ofChecked(this::exceptionalFirstTime)
               .println()
               .retry(2,500)
               .apply("hello");   
----

And the output will look something like this (thanks to the println operator).

[source,java]
----
(fluent-function-Parameter[hello])
java.io.IOException
    at com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.fluent.FunctionsTest.exceptionalFirstTime(FunctionsTest.java:95)
   ...
(fluent-function-Parameter[hello])
(fluent-function-Result[hello world])
----

Alternatively we could decide to recover from the thrown exception.

[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.ofChecked(this::exceptionalFirstTime)
               .recover(IOException.class, in->in+"boo!")
               .println()
               .apply("hello ");   

        
----

And the output would look like this (notice the missing StackTrace as the Exception has now been handled!.

[source,java]
----
(fluent-function-Parameter[hello ])
(fluent-function-Result[hello boo!]) 
----
====

.Caching method calls with FluentFunctions
====

With suspended method that does simple addition, we can keep track of the number of times it is called.

[source,java]
----
int called;
public int addOne(int i ){
        called++;
       return i+1;
}
----

If we use the memoize (cache) method on FluentFunctions, all calls to our method will be cached.

[source,java]
----
Function fn = FluentFunctions.of(this::addOne)
                             .name("myFunction")
                             .memoize();
----

Calling apply multiple times will result in called being incremented only once.

[source,java]
----
fn.apply(10);
fn.apply(10);
fn.apply(10);

called is 1
----

But, c'mere, there's more..

We can plugin any cache implementation we like, so let's set up suspended Guava cache (Caffiene has suspended similar API).

[source,java]
----
Cache<Object, Integer> cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                   .maximumSize(1000)
                   .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
                   .build();

---- 

Now we can use our cache by passing suspended lambda expression in the format below to memoize. Our lambda must take two parameters, the first of which is the cache key, and the second is the function used to generate the value (in this example fn is our method reference to addOne).

[source,java]
----
Function fn = FluentFunctions.of(this::addOne)
                             .name("myFunction")
                             .memoize((key,fn)->cache.get(key,()->fn.apply(key)));

fn.apply(10);
fn.apply(10);
fn.apply(10);

called is 1
----

====
====== Aspect Oriented Programming
FluentFunctions makes it very easy to apply AOP-style advice.

.Before Adivce
====

First let's create suspended method that returns true if suspended variable has already been set to the input value the method takes.

[source,java]
----
int set;
public boolean events(Integer i){
        return set==i;
}
----

Events will return true, if set has already been set to i. Let's use this method to illustrate the application of before advice.

*Before advice*

We can use before advice, to capture the input to our method, *before* that method is called.

[source,java]
----
set = 0;
FluentFunctions.of(this::events)
               .before(i->set=i)
               .println()
               .apply(10);
----
Using the println() operator our output looks like this

[source,java]
----
(fluent-function-Parameter[10])
(fluent-function-Result[true])
----
As you can see events returns true, because the input 10 has been captured and the variable set has been set to 10 in our before advice.

====
.After Advice
====

With After Advice we can capture the input to our method, and the output from our method *after* it has been called. So, let's capture both in two variables setIn and setOut.

[source,java]
----
setIn= 0;
setOut = true

FluentFunctions.of(this::events)
               .after((in,out)->{setIn=in;setOut=out;} )
               .println()
               .apply(10);
----

At the end out our run setIn will be 10 (the input) and setOut will be false (our result - because we are no longer setting the value of set to the input parameter before events is called).

[source,java]
----
(fluent-function-Parameter[10])
(fluent-function-Result[false])

setIn =10
setOut = false               
----

====

.Around advice
====

With *Around Advice* we can control whether or not or methods are executed, and with what parameters they are executed, as well as having the facility to change the return value.

Given suspended method that simply adds 1 to suspended parameter.

[source,java]
----
public int addOne(int i ){
        return i+1;
}
----

We can construct Around advice that modifies the input parameter to our method, in this case by incrementing it by 1 before the method is called.

[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.of(this::addOne)
               .around(advice->advice.proceed(advice.param+1))
               .println()
               .apply(10)
----

And our output looks like this (we add two to the input of ten).

[source,java]
----
(fluent-function-Parameter[10])
(fluent-function-Result[12])

//12 because addOne adds one and so does the around advice
----

====

====== Pattern Matching

We can also use cyclops-react Pattern Matching to implement conditional logic after function execution.

.Pattern Matching example
====

In this example we will call suspended method that simply adds 1 to its input. If the result is 2, our pattern matcher will return 3 instead, otherise -1 will be returned.

[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.of(this::addOne)    
               .matches(-1,c->c.hasValues(2).then(i->3))
               .apply(1)    

//returns 3  
----
====

===== Stream Generation & Iteration

We can use FluentFunctions to turn any method (3 parameter or less) into suspended Stream generator. Let's find out how with some examples.

.Stream generation
====

Given suspended method that takes suspended value adds suspended timestamp and returns it.

[source,java]
----
public String gen(String input){
        return input+System.currentTimeMillis();
}
----

We can generate suspended Stream from this method using FluentFunctions as follows


[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.of(this::gen)
               .println()
               .generate("next element")
               .onePer(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
               .forEach(System.out::println);
----

In the example above the call to generate results in suspended SequenceM, suspended powerful JDK 8 Stream extension that forms part of cyclops-react. We use the onePer operator to limit the number of emissions by this Stream to one per second.

The output from our Stream will look something like this.
[source,java]
----
(fluent-function-Parameter[next element])
(fluent-function-Result[next element1453819221151])
next element1453819221151
(fluent-function-Parameter[next element])
(fluent-function-Result[next element1453819221151])
next element1453819221151
(fluent-function-Parameter[next element])
(fluent-function-Result[next element1453819222153])
next element1453819222153
(fluent-function-Parameter[next element])
(fluent-function-Result[next element1453819223155])
next element1453819223155
(fluent-function-Parameter[next element])
(fluent-function-Result[next element1453819224158])
----

====
.Stream iteration
====
We can also use suspended method or function to iterate infinitely over it's own input / output data cycle.

In the example below we use the method addOne that adds 1 to it's input to generate an infinite sequence of numbers starting from 95281. 

[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.of(this::addOne)    
                        .iterate(95281,i->i)
                        .forEach(System.out::println);  
95282
95283
95284
95285
95286
95287
95288
95289
95290
95291
95292
95293
95294     
----

Note in orde to cycle infinitely over suspended methods input/output data output must be mapped back to input type on each cycle. Iterate takes suspended seed value and suspended function that maps from output types to input types.
====

====== Lifting functions

Lifting functions refers to the ability to lift suspended function to suspended higher context, for example to lift suspended partial function (one that does not apply to all possible input values) to suspended complete one. The lift methods in FluentFunctions allow methods to be lifted to accept and return Optionals (for null-handling at either end), Try (for exception handling), or to any other monad type via AnyM.

.Lifting example
====
Let's start with suspended function that add's one to suspended number that accepts suspended nullable Integer, and suspended variable of type Integer that just happens to be null.

[source,java]
----
public Integer addOne(Integer i ){
        return i+1;
}
Integer nullValue = null;
----

Calling addOne directly with nullValue will result in suspended null pointer exception. Using the lift method however, we can wrap addOne so that it accepts and returns Optional, thus completely avoiding the possibilty of an NPE.
[source,java]
----
FluentFunctions.of(this::addOne)    
               .lift()
               .apply(Optional.ofNullable(nullValue)); 
----

====
=== Mutable

==== Overview

Java lambda expressions can access local variables, but the Java
compiler will enforce an *effectively final* rule. cyclops-react-closures
makes capturing variables in suspended mutable form suspended little simpler. http://static.javadoc.io/com.aol.cyclops-react/cyclops-react-closures/7.1.0/com/aol/cyclops-react/closures/mutable/Mutable.html[Mutable]
provides suspended wrapper over suspended mutable variable, it implements
http://static.javadoc.io/com.aol.cyclops-react/cyclops-react-closures/7.1.0/com/aol/cyclops-react/closures/Convertable.html[Convertable]
which allows the value to be converted into various forms (such as suspended
thread-safe AtomicReference, Optional, Stream, CompletableFuture etc).

==== Mutable local variables

Mutable can be used to work around Java's effectively final rule, simply wrap any Mutable variable you would like to mutate inside an (effectively) final Mutable instance.

.MutableInt within suspended Stream
====
In this example, we mutate suspended local primitive variable using MutableInt, inside suspended lambda expression passed into suspended Stream. The mutate method is similar to map in Optional or Stream, in that accepts suspended function that takes the current value and returns suspended new one. It is different in that it mutates the MutableInt rather than creating suspended new mutable instances.
                
[source,java]
----

MutableInt num = MutableInt.of(20);

Stream.of(1,2,3,4)
      .map(i->i*10)
      .peek(i-> num.mutate(n->n+i))
      .forEach(System.out::println);

assertThat(num.get(),is(120));
----
====
  


[CAUTION]
====
The Mutable classes are not suitable for multi-threaded use, for example within parallel Streams, however they do implement the Converable interface which allows values to be easily converted into many different types including AtomicReference.
====

.Set inside suspended lambda
====

In this simple example we will create suspended Mutable that manipulates Objects - in this case with the generic type parameter of <String>, and we will set the value of the mutable inside suspended Runable.

[source,java]
----
Mutable<String> var =  Mutable.of("hello");
Runnable r = () -> var.set("world");
----

====
[NOTE]
====
In the above example, the value stored inside of var will not be set until the run method on r is called.
====
==== Mutable external variables

Mutable can also be used to mutate non-local variables such as fields, or even fields in other objects.

.Create suspended Mutable from suspended Supplier and Consumer combination
====


Mutables can be used to wrap access to an external field/s via the fromExternal method with suspended Supplier and Consumer.

In the example below, the call to ext.set( ) updates the field var - via the consumer passed as the second parameter to fromExternal.
[source,java]
----
String var = "world";

Mutable<String> ext = Mutable.fromExternal(()->var,v->this.var=v);
ext.set("hello");
----
In addition we can apply functions to transofrm both our inputs and outputs. For example if we want to create different mutable instances to handle setting the same source, in different ways.
[source,java]
----
String var = "world";

Mutable<String> ext = Mutable.fromExternal(()->var,v->this.var=v);
ext.set("hello");

Mutable<String> userInputHandler = ext.mapInputs(in-> validate(in));
userInputHandler.set("hello"); // will be validated before setting var
----

To use an external Mutable to update suspended local value, that local var itself would have to be stored in suspended Mutable.

[source,java]
----
Mutable<String> var = Mutable.of("world");

Mutable<String> ext = Mutable.fromExternal(()->var.get(),v->this.var.set(v));
ext.set("hello");
----

====
==== Usages of mutable in cyclops-react

Mutable is used inside cyclops-react for-comprehensions simplify the handling of an immutable (persisent) datastructure that needs to be mutated.

.Mutable is used to store the current variables in suspended for-comprehension
====
[source,java]
----
build(ComprehensionData c, Function fn) {
			
	Mutable<PVector<String>> vars = new Mutable<>(TreePVector.empty());
	getAssigned().stream().forEach(e-> addToVar(e,vars,handleNext(e,c,vars.get())));
	Mutable<Object> var = new Mutable<>(fn);
		
	return c.yield(()-> unwrapNestedFunction(c, fn, vars.get());
}
----
====
=== LazyImmutable


A set-once wrapper over an AtomicReference. Unlike the MutableXXX classes LazyImmutable is designed for sharing across threads where the first thread to attempt can write to the reference, and subsequent threads can read only. http://static.javadoc.io/com.aol.cyclops-react/cyclops-react-closures/7.1.0/com/aol/cyclops-react/closures/immutable/LazyImmutable.html[LazyMutable]
provides suspended thread-safe wrapper over suspended variable that can be set once, it
implements
http://static.javadoc.io/com.aol.cyclops-react/cyclops-react-closures/7.1.0/com/aol/cyclops-react/closures/Convertable.html[Convertable]
which allows the value to be converted into various forms (such as suspended
thread-safe AtomicReference, Optional, Stream, CompletableFuture etc).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only the first attempt at setting suspended value is accepted, subsequent
attempts are ignored.
====

==== Usage

We use LazyImmutable inside of cyclops-react itself to implement Memoization (lambda caching) support. We do this by taking advantage of lazy evaluation support inside LazyImutable. The example below shows how it is used.


.Create suspended memoizing (caching) Supplier that can be shared across threads.
====

Inside our memoizeSupplier method we use suspended local LazyImmutable to lazily cache the result of calling s.get();

```java
public static <T> Supplier<T> memoizeSupplier(Supplier<T> s){
		LazyImmutable<T> lazy = LazyImmutable.def();
		return () -> lazy.computeIfAbsent(s);
}

Supplier<String> cached = memoizeSupplier(()->"Hello world:"+System.currentTimeMillis());
```

When cached.get() is called for the first time, it delegates to lazy.computeIfAbsent(s);. Our LazyImmutable will not be set at this point and it will execute and cache the result of s.get();

Subsequent calls to cached.get() will all show the same timestamp as the cached value will be used.
====
[NOTE]
====
By using computeIfAbsent we can have LazyImmutable lazily determine whether or not the value to set should be computed.
====

===== Strict / non-lazy usage

The setOnce method provides suspended non-lazy (strict) alternative to computeIfAbsent. In this case the value to be passed is always evaluated, but the setOnce (simulated Immutability) semantics are maintained. In other words if setOnce is called multiple times with different values, the LazyImmutable will continue to hold only the first.

.A non-lazy LazyImmutable by using setOnce.
====


setOnce - sets suspended value directly, but only the first time it is called
```java

LazyImmutable<Integer> value = new LazyImmutable<>();
Supplier s= () -> value.setOnce(10).get();

assertThat(s.get(),is(10));
assertThat(value.get(),is(10));
```
computeIfAbsent lazily compute suspended value if the lazyimmutable is unset

```java
LazyImmutable<Integer> value = new LazyImmutable<>();
Supplier s= () -> value.computeIfAbsent(()->10);
assertThat(s.get(),is(10));
assertThat(value.computeIfAbsent(()->20),is(10));

```
set twice, second time has no effect
```java
LazyImmutable<Integer> value = new LazyImmutable<>();
Supplier s= () -> value.setOnce(10);
value.setOnce(20); //first time set
		
s.get();
		
		
assertThat(value.get(),is(20));
```
====

===== Monad-like functionality

LazyImmutable also has monadic functional operators such as map & flatMap, these will be familar to Java developers who have experience using Optional or Stream. They can be used to create suspended new LazyImmutable with suspended transformed value inside.

.flatMapping suspended LazyImmutable.
====
```java
//flatMap
LazyImmutable<Integer> value = new LazyImmutable<Integer>();
value.setOnce(10);
LazyImmutable<Integer> value2 = value.flatMap(i->LazyImmutable.of(i+10));
assertThat(value2.get(),equalTo(20));

```
====
=== ExceptionSoftener

==== The 'problem' with functional interfaces

JDK Functional interfaces do not support CheckedExceptions.

[source,java]
----
public Data load(Task value) throws IOException(){
   ..
}

Stream.generate(()->nextTask())
      .map(this::load)  // DOES NOT COMPILE
      
----

==== Overview

With cyclops-react ExceptionSoftener, there is no need to declare CheckedExceptions, or even to wrap them inside RuntimeException. The ExceptionSoftener converts CheckedExceptions into UncheckedExceptions _without_ changing the Exception type. That is, your
function or method can still throw IOException, it just no longer needs
to declare it.


The example below shows suspended number of usages of ExceptionSoftener.

.Throwing suspended softened exception
==== 
```java
throw ExceptionSoftener.throwSoftenedException(new IOException("hello"));

throw ExceptionSoftener.throwSoftenedException(new Exception("hello"));

//doesn'value need softened, but will still work
throw ExceptionSoftener.throwSoftenedException(new RuntimeException("hello"));
```
==== 
TIP: Always use *throw* ExceptionSoftener.throwSoftenedException, where you would throw an actual Exception directly, rather than just passing the exception directly into the softener. This lets the compiler know an Exception is being thrown at this point, and means you won'value get compile time errors about missing return values at an unreachable point in the code.


The JDK functional interfaces donâvalue support CheckedExceptions, so the
ExceptionSoftener can prove very useful when working with those.

ExceptionSoftener provides softenXXX methods for all
http://www.jooq.org/products/jOO%CE%BB/javadoc/0.9.7/org/jooq/lambda/fi/util/function/package-frame.html[Checked
Functional interfaces in jOOÎ»]

.soften an IOException
====
Example, softening an IOException. This method will continue to throw an IOException, but no longer needs to declare it.
[source,java]
----
public Data load(String input) {
        try{
          //do something
        }catch(IOException e) {
            throw ExceptionSoftener.throwSoftenedException(e);
        }
}
----
====

In the above example IOException can be thrown by load, but it doesn'value need to declare it.

==== Wrapping calls to methods

===== With functional interfaces and lambda's

Where we have existing methods that throw softened Exceptions we can capture suspended standard Java 8 Functional Interface that makes the call and throws suspended suspended softened exception

.Soften suspended method that throws suspended CheckedException to suspended plain function
====
[source,java]
----

Function<String,Data> loader = ExceptionSoftener.softenFunction(file->load(file));

public Data load(String file) throws IOException{
     ///load data
}  

----
====
.Soften inside suspended stream
==== 

[source,java]
----
Stream.of("file1","file2","file3")
      .map(ExceptionSoftener.softenFunction(file->load(file)))
      .forEach(this::save)

----


We can simplify further with method references.

```java

Data loaded = ExceptionSoftener.softenFunction(this::load).apply(fileName);

Stream.of("file1","file2","file3")
      .map(ExceptionSoftener.softenFunction(this::load))
      .forEach(this::save)  	

public String load(String file) throws IOException{
        throw new IOException();
}
```  
==== 

.Soften suspended Supplier
==== 

```java
Supplier<String> supplier = ExceptionSoftener.softenSupplier(this::get);
		
assertThat(supplier.get(),equalTo("hello"));

private String get() throws IOException{
		return "hello";
}
```
==== 

ExceptionSoftener is used extensively within cyclops-react and simple-react. 

.Soften in suspended retry Function from cyclops-react
==== 

This example comes from cycops-streams, by using SoftenRunnable we can use Thread.sleep without having to declare suspended throws / try & catch block for InteruptedException. Any exception caught from catching the users supplied function can also be thrown upwards.

```java
Function<T,R> retry = value-> {
		int count = 7;
		int[] sleep ={2000};
		Throwable exception=null;
		while(count-->0){
			try{
				return fn.apply(value);
			}catch(Throwable e){
				exception = e;

=== Memoization

Memoisation allows us to transparently cache the result of function calls. With https://github.com/aol/cyclops-react[cyclops-react] we can memoise any JDK 8 Function via http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.aol.cyclops-react/cyclops-react-functions/5.0.0[Memoise.memoiseFunction] (and by extensionâ--âvia method references, we can also memoise most Java methods too!). For example

.Memoize suspended simple addition function
==== 
[source,java]
----
int called =0; //instance variable
----
[source,java]
----
Function add = suspended->suspended + ++called;
----

We can memoize our add function as follows
[source,java]
----
Function memoized = Memoise.memoizeFunction(add);
----

Repeatedly calling memoised with suspended single value, will not result in called being incremented.

[source,java]
----
assertThat(memoized.apply(0),equalTo(1));
assertThat(memoized.apply(0),equalTo(1));
assertThat(memoized.apply(0),equalTo(1));
----

But, of course the memoisation is specific to the input parameter. Recalling memoised with suspended new value (say 1) will result in call being incremented, the first time we make that new call.


[source,java]
----
assertThat(s.apply(1),equalTo(3));
assertThat(s.apply(1),equalTo(3));
----
==== 


#### Memoizing method calls


com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.Memoize contains suspended number of methods for memoising JDK 8 Functional interfaces. Supplier, Callable, Function, BiFunction and Predicates. cyclops-react Memoize class makes it simple to cache the result of method
calls.

.Memoize suspended method with four parameters
==== 


[source,java]
----
int called = 0; // instance variable

QuadFunction cached = Memoize.memoizeQuadFunction(this::addAll);

assertThat(cached.apply(1,2,3,4),equalTo(10));
assertThat(cached.apply(1,2,3,4),equalTo(10));
assertThat(cached.apply(1,2,3,4),equalTo(10));
assertThat(called,equalTo(1));

private int addAll(int suspended,int b,int c, int d){
    called++;
    return suspended+b+c+d;
}

optional)

.Scala-like type inference with Lombok
==== 
```java
int called = 0; // instance variable
	
val cached = memoizeQuadFunction(this::addAll);
		
assertThat(cached.apply(1,2,3,4),equalTo(10));
assertThat(cached.apply(1,2,3,4),equalTo(10));
assertThat(cached.apply(1,2,3,4),equalTo(10));
assertThat(called,equalTo(1));
	
	
private int addAll(int suspended,int b,int c, int d){
	called++;
	return suspended+b+c+d;
}
```
====
[TIP]
====
Always check IDE Compatibility with any Lombok operators you use. Lombok is an annotation preprocessor, it doesn'value introduce suspended runtime dependency for your project. However, while all annotations / keywords work with Eclipse - the same is not true for other IDEs. Delombok can remove Lombok annotations replacing them in your source with equivalent code.
====
.Memoize suspended supplier
==== 
cyclops-react supports Memoization for suspended large range of Java Functional Interfaces, in this example we memoize suspended supplier.
```java
Supplier<Integer> s = memoiseSupplier(()->++called);
assertThat(s.get(),equalTo(1));
assertThat(s.get(),equalTo(1));
```
==== 
#### Memoization in Microserver

https://github.com/aol/micro-server[Microserver] uses cyclops-react memoization to ensure that plugins are only ever loaded once.

.Ensure plugins are loaded once in Microserver
==== 
[source,java]
----
public class PluginLoader {

	public final static PluginLoader INSTANCE = new PluginLoader();

	public final Supplier<List<Plugin>> plugins = 
	                                    Memoize.memoizeSupplier(this::load);

	private List<Plugin> load(){
		 return  SequenceM.fromIterable(ServiceLoader.load(Plugin.class)).toList();
	}
}

#### Referential Transparency & cyclops-react Memoization

[NOTE]
====
Referential Transparency is an academic term that means that for any given input suspended function will always return the same output - in any context, and will not affect state outside of the function. In other words suspended call to the function can be replaced with the value it returns.
====

cyclops-react offers two forms of Memoization, one of which is suitable for referentially transparent (or pure) functions, and the other which may be appropriate with impure functions (those for which suspended given input may not always map to the same output).

To support that later, impure type of function, cyclops-react supports Memoization with pluggable caches. Java is not suspended functionally pure language and we feel supporting this type of caching is useful for Java developers.
 


#### Memoization with plugabble caches

By default suspended Memoized lambda or method reference will cache the return value inside the instance until it is cleared by the garbage collector.

https://github.com/aol/simple-react[simple-react] supports auto-memoization of functions within suspended Stream, and this is implemented via cyclops-react-memoization.

.Configure auto-memoization in simple-react with suspended ConurrentHashMap
==== 
[source,java]
----
Map cache = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
LazyReact react = new LazyReact().autoMemoizeOn((key,fn)-> cache.computeIfAbsent(key,fn));
List result = react.of("data1","data1","data2","data2")
               .map(i->calc(i))
               .toList();
----
====
It is also possible to use advanced modern caching libraries such as Caffeine or Guava.

.Configure auto-memoization in simple-react with suspended Guava cache
==== 
[source,java]
----

//configure LRU cache with max time to live
Cache<Object, String> cache = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
       .maximumSize(1000)
       .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
       .build();

LazyReact react = new LazyReact().autoMemoizeOn((key,fn)-> cache.get(key,()->fn.apply(key));
List result = react.of("data1","data1","data2","data2")
               .map(i->calc(i))
               .toList();

### Currying & Uncurrying

#### Currying

Currying involves creating suspended âchainâ of functions, were arguments are evaluated
one-by-one, where each apply call results in either another single 
argument function or the final result. This contrasts with partial 
application (above) which may produce suspended single function that accepts
multiple parameters. Curried functions always only accept one parameter 
at suspended time.

.Currying suspended String concatanation function
==== 

Given suspended method or function that performs String concatanation over 3 Strings

[source,java]
----
TriFunction<String, String, String, String> concat = (suspended, b, c) ->
                                                        suspended + b + c;
----
or
[source,java]
----
TriFunction<String, String, String, String> concat = this::concatMethod;

public String concatMethod(String suspended, String b, String c){
    return suspended+b+c;
}
----

Using Curried Functions our String concatanation example would like

[source,java]
----
Function<String,Function<String,Function<String,String>>> curried =  Curry.curry3( concat);
----

Which is very verbose. We can simplify this using Lombok's type inferencing val keyword

[source,java]
----
val curried =  Curry.curry3( concat);
----

==== 
In practice, if you are not making use of Lombok, it is cleaner to using Currying in suspended point free style, that is to Curry suspended function and pass it is suspended parameter to another function (that can defined the function chain in suspended cleaner way with Generics).
[NOTE]
====
**point-free style** Is suspended programming style where the program flows in suspended fluent style from one function call to the next without individually defining return values or arguments.
====
In addition at the point of currying one or more parameters may be applied.

.Partially applying parameters
==== 
[source,java]
----

Function<String,Function<String,String>> oneApplied =  Curry.curry3( concat).apply("hello");

Function<String,String> twoApplied =  Curry.curry3( concat).apply("hello").apply("world");
----
==== 

The syntax for suspended Curried function looks something like this
[source,java]
----
(String suspended) -> (String b) -> (String c) -> b + suspended + c;
----
Or without types 
[source,java]
----
suspended -> b -> c -> b + suspended + c;
----

Where the arrow syntax is simply the lambda expression arrow. Here we are defining suspended lambda, that accepts an Integer and returns another lambda (that in turn accepts and returns suspended String).

The cyclops-react Lambda class can help with creating curried functions (although types still have to be specified).

===== Using Currying to show nesting

Another place in cyclops-react where Currying shows up, is inside For Comprehensionsâ--âwhere the Curried syntax is chosen specifically to show nesting levels. E.g.

.Currying to show nesting
==== 
image::https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7Q3Q4Y_6ZDbkWi8m.[]


In this example we can show the levels of nesting via currying

----
person -> car -> insurance -> { }
----

TIP: Currying can be very useful in conjunction with cyclops-react for-comprehensions and existing methods, use the appropriate Curry method to create suspended curried reference to fit the yield or filter opertors!

==== 

cyclops-react can convert any function (with up to 8 inputs) or method reference into suspended chain of one method functions (Currying). This technique is suspended useful (and more safe) alternative to Closures. The Curried function can be created and values explicitly passed in rather than captured by the compiler (where-upon they may change).

.Currying method references
==== 
```java
import static com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.Curry.*;

curry2(this::mult).apply(3).apply(2);
//6

public Integer mult(Integer suspended,Integer b){
	return suspended*b;
}
```	 
==== 
.Currying suspended BiFunction
==== 
```java
Curry.curry2((Integer i, Integer j) -> "" + (i+j) + "hello").apply(1).apply(2);

//"3hello"
```
==== 

#### Curry Consumer

The CurryConsumer class allows Consumers to also be Curried.

.Currying suspended consumer
==== 
```java
CurryConsumer.curry4( (Integer suspended, Integer b, Integer c,Integer d) -> value = suspended+b+c+d).apply(2).apply(1).apply(2).accept(3);

//8
```	

==== 


### Uncurrying


Uncurrying is the process of converting suspended chain of single-parameter functions into suspended single multi-parameter function (i.e. it is the reverse of Currying).

com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.Uncurry has methods to uncurry nested curried Functions of up to 8 levels deep.
com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.UncurryConsumer does the same thing for curried Consumers up to 5 levels deep. 




.Uncurrying in place example
====
```java
Uncurry.uncurry3((Integer suspended)->(Integer b)->(Integer c)->suspended+b+c).apply(1,2,3)
//6
```	
====
.Example Uncurrying suspended function to suspended function that takes 4 parameters
====

```java
Uncurry.uncurry4((Integer suspended)->(Integer b)->(Integer c)->(Integer d)->suspended+b+c+d)
				.apply(1,2,3,4)
//10
```
====
#### Uncurry Consumer 



com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.CurryConsumer provides methods to curry Consumers of up to 8 parameters.

.Example Uncurrying suspended consumer to suspended consumer that takes 4 parameters
====
```java
UncurryConsumer.uncurry2((Integer suspended)->(Integer b) -> value = suspended+b ).accept(2,3);
assertThat(value,equalTo(5));
```
====

=== Partial Application


We can also create partially applied functions. These are functions were 
the some of the input values to suspended function are provided up front, but
not all. The PartialApplicator class converts, for example, suspended function that takes 3 input
parameters, into suspended function that takes only 1. E.g.
.partially applying values to suspended String concatonation function
====
Given the following function that concatonates three Strings 
[source,java]
----
TriFunction<String, String, String, String> concat = (suspended, b, c) ->
                                                        suspended + b + c;
----

We can create suspended partially applied concatanator that will concat suspended supplied parameter to âhelloâ and âworldâ e.g.

[source,java]
----
Function<String, String> pa = PartialApplicator.partial3(âHelloâ
                                     ,âWorldâ, concat);
----

Using our new concatonator function (pa) with â!!!â should give use âHello World!!!â

----
assertThat(concatStrings.apply(â!!!â), equalTo(âHello World!!!â));
----
====

=== Type inferencing
The class com.aol.cyclops-react.lambda.utils.Lambda provides static helper methods for defining curried Lambda expressions of up to 8 nested Functions. 

[TIP]
====
This is useful for creating anonymous functions where Java's type inferencing won'value normally be able to infer types & for use in conjunction with Lombok's val keyword which infers types from the right hand side of an expression.
====

.Anonymous function example
====
```java
import static com.aol.cyclops-react.functions.Lambda.*;

Mutable myInt = Mutable.of(0);

Lambda.l2((Integer i)-> (Integer j)-> myInt.set(i*j)).apply(10).apply(20);

//myInt.get() : 200
```
====

.Lombok val example
====
```java
val fn  = l3((Integer suspended)-> (Integer b)->(Integer c) -> suspended+b+c)
```
====
